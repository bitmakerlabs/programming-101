# Programming 101

A weekend workshop at Bitmaker that introduces all of the concepts required to build a simple web application from start to finish.

## Getting setup

We'll do our best to keep the tools to a minimum so you can focus on the concepts and learning how to code. That being said, we need to install a few programs, some to power our application and others to make our coding workflow easy and efficient.

### [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

We'll use Google Chrome as the web browser in this workshop. It provides some very powerful tools for developers that we'll be using to learn more about how the web works, how web pages are rendered and how code runs in a web browser.

### [Atom](http://atom.io)

Atom is our text editor of choice and where we'll be writing all of our code. It provides some powerful features specifically geared toward writing code like highlighting keywords in many programming languages and the ability to easily jump between files in a project (among many others!).

### [Heroku Toolbox](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

Heroku is a service that makes it super simple to deploy web applications created with Ruby. It requires a free account, [which you can sign up for here](https://www.heroku.com). The Heroku Toolbox simplifies the process of getting your app on the web down to a small handful of commands.

### [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. We'll be using it to write the code that runs on the web server and interacts with our database.

#### Mac OS X

Mac users already have Ruby installed! If you're running Mac OS X Mavericks, Yosemite or El Capitan, you've got the latest major version of Ruby (2.0) installed on your computer.

**If you're running an older version of Mac OS X** we'll need to do an advanced setup on your computer, make sure you ask an instructor for help in that case.

#### Microsoft Windows

Windows users need to install Ruby on their computer using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/). Download and install the latest version available (don't use the x64 variant, even if you're running 64-bit system).

### Having problems? Don't panic!

If you have any issues, don't panic, we're here to help and we'll make sure you've got it sorted out by the time you need to use it.
